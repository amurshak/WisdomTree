      Widsom Tree is for seekers of knowledge who wish to be inculcated in the
      tradition of the great works of human history. All who wander are not
      lost, but those seeking wisdom often walk a narrow, winding road. The
      Wisdom Tree hopes to find you at the outset of your journey, to aid in the
      unceasing quest for self-discovery. Here at Wisdom Tree, we think to
      understand oneself is to understand the world of which one is a part. The
      most powerful and enduring books humanity has produced represent the
      accumulated knowledge of many lifetimes, and a range of perspectives
      uncapturable for one mind. Given the surfeit of influential, impactful,
      great works to choose from, starting donw a journey of self-understanding
      through reading the Great Works can be overwhelming. Wisdom Tree was
      created to empower you to formulate your own path towards wisdom.
